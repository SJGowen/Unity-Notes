üéÆ Unity 6 Game Dev Prep ‚Äì Week 5 (Gameplay Mechanics)

‚∏ª

‚è≠Ô∏è What‚Äôs Coming in Week 5

Week 5 Topics:
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Camera and Player Movement
	‚Ä¢	Adding Enemy AI with Chasing and Collision
	‚Ä¢	Power-up and Countdown Systems
	‚Ä¢	Wave-Based Enemy Spawning
	‚Ä¢	Challenge Day: Soccer Scripting & Personal Project Expansion

‚∏ª

‚úÖ How to Prepare

1. üé• Camera Systems in Unity
	‚Ä¢	Learn Cinemachine (follow camera, zoom effects, shake).
	‚Ä¢	Useful tutorials: Unity Learn or Brackeys on YouTube.

2. üß† Enemy AI (Basic)
	‚Ä¢	Use Vector3.MoveTowards, transform.LookAt for simple chasing.
	‚Ä¢	Will be used in wave spawning logic and collision-based game mechanics.

3. ‚è±Ô∏è Timers and Power-Ups
	‚Ä¢	Learn Time.deltaTime, Invoke(), and Coroutines for countdowns and temporary effects.

4. üîÅ Wave Spawning
	‚Ä¢	Use for loops and Coroutines to spawn enemies every X seconds.
	‚Ä¢	Randomized spawn positions make it more dynamic.

üßæ Scripts to Practice

üîª EnemyChase.cs

using UnityEngine;

public class EnemyChase : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform player;
    public float speed = 3f;

    void Update()
    {
        if (player != null)
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(
                transform.position,
                player.position,
                speed * Time.deltaTime
            );
            transform.LookAt(player);
        }
    }
}


‚∏ª

üîª WaveSpawner.cs

using UnityEngine;

public class WaveSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject enemyPrefab;
    public Transform[] spawnPoints;
    public int enemiesPerWave = 5;
    public float timeBetweenWaves = 10f;

    private void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(SpawnWaves());
    }

    System.Collections.IEnumerator SpawnWaves()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < enemiesPerWave; i++)
            {
                int index = Random.Range(0, spawnPoints.Length);
                Instantiate(enemyPrefab, spawnPoints[index].position, Quaternion.identity);
                yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);
            }

            yield return new WaitForSeconds(timeBetweenWaves);
        }
    }
}

üõ†Ô∏è Mini Game Setup: ‚ÄúSurvive the Waves‚Äù

üéØ Objective:

Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves in a small arena using player movement and simple AI.

üß± Scene Structure:

Scene
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player (with PlayerController script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnemySpawner (with WaveSpawner script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SpawnPoints (4+ empty objects)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Camera (or Cinemachine Virtual Cam)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ground (plane) + optional walls


‚∏ª

üîª PlayerController.cs

using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    Rigidbody rb;
    Vector3 movement;

    void Start() => rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

    void Update()
    {
        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        movement = new Vector3(moveX, 0f, moveZ);
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        rb.MovePosition(rb.position + movement * moveSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime);
    }
}


‚∏ª

üì∑ Camera Setup
	‚Ä¢	Install Cinemachine (via Package Manager)
	‚Ä¢	Add Cinemachine Virtual Camera
	‚Ä¢	Follow and Look At your Player
	‚Ä¢	Adjust for 3rd person or top-down view

‚∏ª

üå± Extend It Later
	‚Ä¢	Add UI elements for timer, score, or health
	‚Ä¢	Implement power-ups (e.g., speed boost, temporary invincibility)
	‚Ä¢	Use sound effects and particles for polish

‚∏ª

Let me know if you‚Äôd like:
	‚Ä¢	A UnityPackage download link
	‚Ä¢	More advanced features like object pooling or enemy states
	‚Ä¢	Help integrating UI or game-over logic

You‚Äôre doing great ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a real foundation for making full games. Ready to level up your Week 5 with custom logic or effects?
